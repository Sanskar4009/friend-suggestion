# friend-suggestion
A C++ project that implements a basic friend suggestion system using graph data structures and Breadth-First Search (BFS). The system simulates a small-scale social network where users are represented as graph nodes, and friendships are represented as edges. It suggests new friends to a user based on mutual connections (friends-of-friends logic)
